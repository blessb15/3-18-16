              My name is Blake Bless and I am 19 years old. I have not always had an interest in technology. In high school I was inspired to take any computer related classes that they offered. I took many different tech classes in highschool some including Computer Tech, Web design, drafting, game design, and
              Windows apps. I enjoyed these classes a lot. I wouldn't say that I knew I wanted to take a career path in web design or devlopement after high school, but I was definitely becoming more and more interested in the idea. Programming was more of a hobby at this point.
              I had quite a few different jobs, trying to figure out what I might have an interest in. I knew I wanted to work with computers, and I was really into design. I had become pretty good at Illustrator and Photoshop while messing around with the two
              in highschool. After high school I thought about going to a university like PSU but I knew I didn't have the money or the interest in going into loads of debt. I started looking for alternatives to working towards a career working
              with computers. I found out about these programs called bootcamps. I remember the first one I was interested in was Hack Reactor. Hack Reactor is one of the more spendy bootcamps, and
              they have a 12 week program which seemed too short considering the amount of money it would've cost. I started looking for boot camps in Portland, and was surprised when I found Epicodus. Epicodus was definitely different from it's competition.
              Epicodus is significantly cheaper than the majority of bootcamps, and the promgram itself is way longer than all the others. I was so excited, I signed up and started within two weeks. I have now graduated Epicodus and have learned a lot from my time there.
              I am now fluent in languages like Java and JavaScript and have become very good at the design/and back-end of building websites. I learned a variety of different frameworks like Angular2, Ember, and Bootstrap. After Epicodus I started interning at BowTie.io and just
              recently finished my internship their. While Working at Bowtie.io, I was tasked with adding features to the templates that their site used to create sites. All the work was focused around making
              it easier for a new user to create a static site, quickly and more efficiently. BowTie has strengthened my skills in JS, Jekyll, CSS and Liquid. I learned a lot from my time as an intern at BowTie. I am very pleased to have been able to work alongside some great
              developers.
