              My name is Blake Bless and I am 19 years old. I have not always had an interest in technology, it all started when I moved to a new church and I met one of my best friends, David. David was the lead
              worship pastor, he also has a pretty big background in computer knowledge. I started talking with him more and learning things about computers that I had never known before.
              I was inspired to take any computer related classes that my high school offered. I took classes like computer tech, html, drafting, game design,
              windows apps. I enjoyed these classes a lot, they were able to expand my knowledge of computers even more. After taking the game design class I thought it would be cool to try and make a game of my own,
              which I am still working on today,<strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0nj86rw8584d3jm/4.7.16%20test.exe?dl=0"> here</a></strong> is the download link to the most current build(Windows users only). I wouldn't say
              that I knew I wanted to take a career path in game design or compter science. Honestly I had no idea what I wanted to do until I was almost 2 years out of highschool. I had quite a few different jobs,
              trying to figure out what I might have an interest in. I worked for an electrical company thinking "It might be fun to be an electrician" but I knew that wasnt what I really wanted. I knew I really
              wanted to work with computers. I thought about a university but I knew that would put me in loads of debt, so I started looking for other ways I could start working towards a career in computer
              technology. I found out about these programs called bootcamps. They sounded super intense. I remember the first one I was interested in was Hack Reactor which turned out to be way more expensive
              than I thought was necessary and extremely far away from home. I started looking for boot camps in portland, and was surprised at what I found, Epicodus. I thought it was so cool that I was so close
              to the program and that it was way cheaper than the majority of bootcamps. I signed up and started within two weeks. I am super excited to be working towards a career path that I know I will enjoy.
