              My name is Blake Bless and I am 19 years old. I have not always had an interest in technology, it all started when I moved to a new church and I met one of my best friends, David. David was the lead
              worship pastor, he also has a pretty big background in computer knowledge. I started talking with him more and learning things about computers.
              I was inspired to take any computer related classes that my high school offered. I took many different tech classes in highschool some including Computer Tech, Web design, drafting, game design,
              windows apps. I enjoyed these classes a lot. After taking the game design class I thought it would be cool to try and make a game of my own,
              which I am still working on today, <strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0nj86rw8584d3jm/4.7.16%20test.exe?dl=0"> here</a></strong> is the download link to the most current build (Windows users only). I wouldn't say
              that I knew I wanted to take a career path in game design or computer science. Honestly I had no idea what I wanted to do until I was almost 2 years out of highschool. I had quite a few different jobs,
              trying to figure out what I might have an interest in. I worked for an electrical company thinking "It might be fun to be an electrician" but I knew that wasn't what I really wanted. I knew I really
              wanted to work with computers. I thought about a university but I knew i didn't want to be another student with loads of debt, so I started looking for other ways I could start working towards a career working
              with computers. I found out about these programs called bootcamps. They sounded super intense. I remember the first one I was interested in was Hack Reactor which turned out being too much of a hassle, and
              their program was very short. than I thought was necessary and extremely far away from home. I started looking for boot camps in portland, and was surprised at what I found, Epicodus. I thought it was so cool,
              I was so close to the school, and it was significantly cheaper than the majority of bootcamps now days. I signed up and started within two weeks. I have now graduated Epicodus and have learned a lot from my time there.
              I am now fluent in languages like Java and JavaScript and am very comfortable in a variety of different framworks. I am currently participating at an internship at BowTie.io, where I am working with their static site
              generator, that is based around jekyll. My time at BowTie has had me working with lots of JS, Jekyll, and Liquid. I have added many new features to their static templates all my work has been focused around making
              it easier for a new user to create a static site more quickly and efficiently. Below are some projects that I have been working on throughout school and on my own time.
